# Task:
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

is_palidndrome_permutation(string)

# Things to consider / ask interviewer
    - Examples when string is a permutation of palindrome
        TRUE: "Tact Coa" â€”> "atco cta"
        FALSE: "Taco Bello"
    - ignore casing? Yes
    - ignore non-letter characters (numbers as well)? Yes

# Idea
Observation: If more than one letter is odd (doesn't have a pair) it means that 
the string can't be a palindrome.

    1. Remove whitespace and make it lowercase
    2. Count occurrence of each letter
    3. Check if more than one occurence is odd - if yes it can't be a palindrome

TODO: GPT Analysis

1. You've chosen to build the code around an interesting observation that "If more than one letter is odd, it doesn't have a pair". Could you please explain your thought process behind this?

Palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwards. In other words it's first half is a mirror of second half. Therefore there can be only one odd letter (or none). If there is such letter it would be in the middle of palindrome.

2. In the part of the code where you normalize the string by removing special characters and converting it to lower case -- is there a specific reason you chose to do so?
3. You've used a dictionary (occurrences) to store the count of each character in the string. Could you explain why you chose a dictionary? Was there any specific benefits that came with it?
4. In the part where you check for odd counts, there are conditional branches. Could you explain their purpose and how they help ascertain whether the string can be a palindrome or not?
5. Related to space and time complexity:
   - Space: You've mentioned the space complexity to be O(n) because of the input string and the dictionary. Are there any ways you can think of for optimizing the space complexity or is this the most optimal in your opinion?
   - Time: You've observed the time complexity
